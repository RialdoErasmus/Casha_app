# casha_project

 I just wanted to put some extra clarification in this ReadMe file to explain something about my code. I wrote out a series of steps on how I can solve the problem and I then tried to put those steps I wrote down directly into code. After that I would usually go and see how I can make the code shorter but I decided to leave it as it is so you can see my thought process on how I can solve the problem. I know there are many other methods of solving the problem I just thought this might be best so you can see how my logical thinking/reasoning works.
